     eFootball is an association football simulation video game

     series to the eFootball series.[1] The game's first year, entitled eFootball 2022, was released
      on 30 September 2021. It was later changed to the game's second year, eFootball 2023, on August 25, 2022.
     This game is part of IESF World Championship and North and Eastern Europa League (NEEC).
